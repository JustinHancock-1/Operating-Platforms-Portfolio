- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The Gaming Room is a video game company that has a game already launched on Android that is similar to the old Draw it or Lose It game. They wanted me to come up with a solution to make the game web based. 
  
- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I provided The Gaming Room with appropriste solutions for their needs keeping into consiteration overall costs, revenue, and potential further expansion of the game onto other platforms.
  
- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  I found that working through the design document helped me more with the business side of things than actually developing the code itself. I felt that the design document was more of a business proposal than something like a flowchart or pseudocode or a UML Diagram that directly relates to the code itself. It did make me consider what coding language I would use; however, for this assignment, we had to use Java.
  
- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  The only thing I would change is the formatting on the evaluation section. The formatting that the template gave us was a little small and it makes that section of the document difficult to read and follow. I would put that into paragraph form and present it that way. 
  
- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I treated the clients needs like my own. I read their problem and created a solution. I think this comes into some of the ethical side of programming where you have to keep in mind the clients needs over your own. So being mindful of time and money spent on the project should be a top priority along with making sure the clients needs are met the best and most appropriate way.
  
-  How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  Designing the software is very new to me so following the book here was very helpful. I would have never guessed that there are so many different methods to designing software. I did enjoy learning the Singleton Pattern to create a UML Diagram to help with coding the program. I feel there are probably some other options out there thst I may use, but since we were only required to run the Singleton Method, this is the one that I focused on the most. I really like being able to use Flowcharts. They help me visualize how I need to write a program. I really liked the overall presentation of this project. I could see myself taking this document and turning it into PDF form and presenting it to a board or people for a specific project.
